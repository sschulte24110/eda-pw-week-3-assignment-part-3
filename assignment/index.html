      <ol>
        <li>I have been using let instead of const when the instructions say to create a variable. I try to use const when it says to create a constant.</li>
        <li>For stretch goal #8, I am sure there are other ways to do this. I ended up showing 3 ways an named them totalSupply, totalSupply2 and totalSupply3.</li>
        <li>Stretch goal #9 was fun to figure out. Hopefully, my result is correct. It was able to log the correct amounts, but there is always another way to do it.</li>
