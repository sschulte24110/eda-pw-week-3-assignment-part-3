      <ol>
        <li>I have been using let instead of const when the instructions say to create a variable. I try to use const when it says to create a constant. I know you have said use const until it throws an error, so please let me know if I should be doing that instead.</li>
        <li>For stretch goal #8, I ended up showing 3 other ways with a function and named them totalSupply, totalSupply2 and totalSupply3. They are commented out.</li>
        <li>Stretch goal #9 was fun to figure out. Hopefully, my result is correct. It was able to log the correct amounts, but there is always another way to do it.</li>
